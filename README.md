# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic **Snake Game** using Java Swing and IntelliJ as the IDE.

## Summary

* The Snake Game is a popular arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves on a plane within a closed boundary, consuming food items and growing longer.
* In this project, I got to explore and learn how the Java language works through libraries and methods. Familiar with object-oriented programming and its working principles.
* Introduced the Java Swing and java.awt libraries through implementation and method inheritance.
* Additionally, we develop skills in selecting and processing images and sounds to suit the project.
* Through the game, we expand our programming thinking and improve problem-solving skills. This project is especially useful for programmers who are new to the Java language.

## How to Play the Game

* Just download the SnakeGame file from [Snake Game](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_SWx1VFqypE7UEm12cEIN91LdKU0NRzI) or from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_SWx1VFqypE7UEm12cEIN91LdKU0NRzI).

* Run the executable file. You will be directed to the homepage.

* Click on the play button to start the game.
* Control the snake with the arrow keys ("UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", and "RIGHT"), simulating user interaction with the game. Each time the snake catches an apple, its size increases, and the user's score is incremented by 1 point.
* If the snake hits its tail or a wall, the game ends. Enjoy the basic interface and attractive sound effects.
